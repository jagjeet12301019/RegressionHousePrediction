# RegressionHousePrediction
Multiple Machine Learning Models Tested for Regression task of House price prediction

Dataset we are using is downloaded from the Kaggle competition on same task named as “Predict Future Sales” (Kaggle,). Machine Learning is a vast field with multiple subsets and is evolving day by day. We have many different types of robust prototype models available already with us which are developed from extensive research works along with well-defined methodologies which already have proved best in many cases. For example, which models are best to use for regression tasks and which one are suitable for Classification. 
Time series problems are where we need to predict what can happen in future by using the historical data and machine learning algorithms. Here in this study, we are performing analysis on a dataset from Kaggle with the goal to model different solutions and choose the one best fit for this particular task. In this scenario, we take into consideration different features for the product sold in some last years and modeled our solution accordingly to get the best results to predict future. This study is a time-series analysis and regression model design. Goal of this study is to verify working of some well-known algorithms on this dataset and choose the best by performing a comparative study.
